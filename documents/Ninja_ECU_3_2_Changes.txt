Ninja ECU 3.2 Changes

-This document is a list of physical hardware changes we need to make to each board in order for it to work, specific to ECU 3.2.
The actual errors are lised in the text document name "Ninja_ECU_Errors" in this same folder.These are the soldering changes and 
fixes we made on the first board and need to apply to the other three.

1. Using an exacto knife, cut the line connecting pin 18 of the DRV chip to its nearby via. Solder a wire directly to pin 18, this
wire needs to be quite long as it needs to wrap around the board to the microcontroller
2. There are two resistors connecting encoder 4 to the microcontroller pins 59 and 60. Desolder these resistors and move them to 
the right so that only one end of the resistor is on the right pad and the other is not connected.
3. Solder the other end of the DRV wire to the now empty pad that connects to pin 60 of the microcontroller. The PWM signal is fixed.
4. Solder a wire to the unconnected side of R21 and connect it to pin 63 of the microcontroller. 
5. Solder-bridge 64 and 65 together to make connecting the other resistor easier. Do the same process to connect R17 to the pin 64
and pin 65 bridge. We must not use pin 65. Now we have our encoder back.
6. For the FT4232 we need to switch the lines coming from 26 and 27 of the FTDI chip. Cut the line, shave off the mask, and solder
a wire to the exposed track. Do for both lines.
7. Connect the pin 27 line to pin 1 of the MAX and connect the pin 26 line to pin 4 of the MAX.
8. Desolder pins 5 and 8 of the MAX and lift them off their pads.
9. Solder a wire to pin 5, scrape off the mask from the ground plane just above this pin, and solder the other end of the wire to
the exposed polygon.
10. Solder a wire to pin 8 of the MAX and solder the other end to the nearby 3.3V via.
